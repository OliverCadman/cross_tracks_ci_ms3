## UX
### Strategy
#### Vision
Having been an active member in the musical community for more than a decade, and being a life long lover of music, there have been many occasions where I have reached a plateau when trying to find new artists and music that I really enjoy and get stuck into. Discovering new music often involves endless scouring of music label websites, YouTube and Spotify. While it is indeed a fun past time, it is rare that an artist or track is discovered that truly speaks to me. However, there is of course another way to discover music, which is through word of mouth; of recommandation. It's much more often that I find great music when I am listening to, or talking about music with a friend. As well as being a more efficient way to discover great music, it's also a lot more enjoyable to appreciate music around other music lovers.

With this, the vision of Cross//Tracks is to provide users with the ability to find music by recommendation, and to build a friendly community of like-minded musical aficionados, who can rely on eachother when they're in need of a new musical fix.

#### Site Owner Goals

1. To create a robust platform, which they themselves can enjoy and discover music through.
2. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to add, edit and delete their recommendations.
3. Implement defensive design through application of data validation and authentication.
4. To allow for simple and intuitive navigation of the website.
5. Establish Cross//Tracks as a trusted and recognisable brand to both new and returning visitors.
6. Provide excellent UX to maximise visitorâ€™s dwell time and minimise bounce rate, so as to maximise SEO and brand recognition.
7. Employ a mobile-first design, whilst ensuring the website is responsive across all device sizes.
