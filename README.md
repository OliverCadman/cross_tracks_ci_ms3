# Cross//Tracks
Cross//Tracks is an online music sharing platform, where music lovers around the world can share their favourite tracks, and expand on their own collection of music with new discoveries shared by the Cross//Tracks community.

The platform will allow users to browse a complete list of shared tracks, search/filter tracks by Genre, Artist Name or Year of Release, leave comments, and give tracks a star rating.


## UX
### Strategy
#### Vision
Having been an active member in the musical community for more than a decade, and being a life long lover of music, there have been many occasions where I have reached a plateau when trying to find new artists and music that I really enjoy and get stuck into. Discovering new music often involves endless scouring of music label websites, YouTube and Spotify. While it is indeed a fun past time, it is rare that an artist or track is discovered that truly speaks to me. However, there is of course another way to discover music, which is through word of mouth; of recommandation. It's much more often that I find great music when I am listening to, or talking about music with a friend. As well as being a more efficient way to discover great music, it's also a lot more enjoyable to appreciate music around other music lovers.

With this, the vision of Cross//Tracks is to provide users with the ability to find music by recommendation, and to build a friendly community of like-minded musical aficionados, who can rely on eachother when they're in need of a new musical fix.

#### Site Owner Goals

1. To create a robust platform, which they themselves can enjoy and discover music through.
2. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to add, edit and delete their recommendations.
3. Implement defensive design through application of data validation and authentication.
4. To allow for simple and intuitive navigation, and understanding of the website.
5. Establish Cross//Tracks as a trusted and recognisable brand to both new and returning visitors.
6. Provide excellent UX to maximise visitorâ€™s dwell time and minimise bounce rate, so as to maximise SEO and brand recognition.
7. Employ a mobile-first design, while ensuring the website is responsive across all device sizes.

#### Target Audience

Potential visitors to the website could include:

1. Musicians/Music Fans - The Cross//Tracks website could serve as a solution, in the case when musicians (or fans of music) aren't able to meet in person and trade music and ideas. This case is particularly topical since the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the inability for people to meet up in person, and trade or enjoy music together.
2. Younger people - The platform could be particularly attractive to the younger generation (16-25 years), who are generally more tech savvy, inclined to social media trends, and would welcome a social media platform centered around sharing and discovering music.


#### User Stories

As a visitor using the website for the first time, I want...

1. The purpose of the website to be clearly evident upon first visit, so I can be sure that my needs will be met.
2. To be able to navigate the website intuitively and with ease, so that my time isn't wasted.
3. To view the tracks easily using a minimal click count, so I can browse the tracks with ease.
4. To be able to search for tracks based on different criteria (Genre, Artist Name, Year of Release), so I can search for tracks more granularly.
5. To view comments on a particular track, so I find out what other users have to say about the music and engage with the community.


As a returning visitor, I want...

1. To be able to read and write comments on tracks which have been shared by others, so I can communicate and build relationships with other users of the website.
2. The details of users who share a particular track to be clearly visible, so I can browse their profile and find out more about their musical tastes.
3. To register and build my own profile, so I am able to locate my saved tracks.
4. To be able to Add, Edit and Delete my own track information, so I can share tracks with other users of the website.
5. To be able to save/like tracks which I come across when browsing, so they are saved to my profile.
6. To be able to contact the site owner, so I can leave feedback.

### Scope

Unfortunately, some trade-offs will have to be considered in order complete the project in time for the production deployment deadline. Since the central focus of the platform is to share music, it would of course be ideal if users had the option to sample the tracks on display from the website directly. Perhaps there is a chance that this functionality can be achieved through the utilisation of Spotify's API; if there is sufficient time once the features for an MVP have been implemented, then efforts will indeed be made for a playback feature to be implemented. Furthermore, it would be ideal for users to be able to message eachother, so that communities can be grow and more music can be discovered. It is currently beyond the scope of the developer's skillset to implement a messaging service.

Until then, below are the main features required for a Minimal Viable Product:

1. Home Page displaying all tracks
2. Ability to Register, Login and Logout
3. Full CRUD Functionality to Add, Read, Edit and Delete Tracks.
4. A page for users to add tracks to the platform.
5. Cards to display tracks, with button to open modal/dropdown
6. Modal window/dropdown to display more information and comments left about relative tracks.
7. Search/Filter functionality
8. Profile Page for Users
9. Functionality for users to edit profile
10. Contact Page
11. 404 Page
12. Admin Priveleges (to manage Genres and Tracks)

Features for future releases:

1. Enable users to play tracks directly from the website.
2. Allow users to message eachother directly.
3. Allow users to add eachother as friends.
4. Display users Spotify playlists
5. Upload and display a user profile picture
